# Weave Project README üåêüßµ

## Project Overview

Weave is a social media application built on the MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Below is an overview of the technologies and libraries used in both frontend and backend development.

### Frontend

- **React with Vite:** Weave's frontend is developed using React with Vite as the build tool. Vite provides fast and efficient development and builds processes.

- **React Query:** For server state management, React Query is employed. It simplifies the management of remote data fetching, caching, and state synchronization.

- **Redux Toolkit:** Global state management and persistence are handled by Redux Toolkit. It ensures a predictable state container and aids in managing complex state logic.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling is done using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that helps in building modern and responsive user interfaces.

- **Shadcn:** The component library used in the project is Shadcn. It provides a set of reusable and well-designed components for building the user interface.

- **Axios:** Data fetching from the server is facilitated by Axios, a promise-based HTTP client that works seamlessly with React applications.

- **TypeScript:** The project is developed using TypeScript, adding static typing to enhance code quality and developer experience.

- **React Hook Form:** For form validation, React Hook Form is utilized. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage and validate forms in React applications.

### Backend

- **Node.js and Express.js:** The backend is developed using Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime, and Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. Together, they provide a robust and scalable server environment.

- **MongoDB with Mongoose:** MongoDB is used as the database, and Mongoose is the MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. It simplifies interactions with the MongoDB database.

- **Custom Credential Authentication:** Weave includes a custom authentication system based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This allows for secure and efficient user authentication.

## Project Features üöÄ

Weave comes with the following features:

- **User Login/Logout:** Allow users to securely log in and out of the platform.

- **Email Verification:** Verify user email addresses for added security.

- **Reset Password/Forgot Password:** Provide users with the ability to reset their passwords in case they forget them.

- **CRUD Post:** Allow users to create, read, update, and delete posts.

- **CRUD Comment:** Enable users to create, read, update, and delete comments on posts.

- **Share Post:** Users can share posts on the platform.

- **Reply to Comment:** Allow users to reply to comments on posts.
